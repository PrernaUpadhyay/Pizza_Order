# Python Pizza Order üçï

This is a simple **Pizza Order** script built with Python. The program asks users for their preferences regarding pizza size, additional toppings, and extra cheese, then calculates and displays the final bill based on the selected options.

## How It Works

1. **Pizza Size:**  
   The user selects a pizza size: 
   - Small (`S`): $15
   - Medium (`M`): $20
   - Large (`L`): $25

2. **Additional Toppings:**  
   If the user opts for additional toppings:
   - Small pizza: $2 extra
   - Medium or Large pizza: $3 extra

3. **Extra Cheese:**  
   If the user chooses extra cheese, an additional $1 is added to the total.

4. The program then calculates and displays the final bill.

## Input Prompts

- **Size:** The user is prompted to input `S`, `M`, or `L` for pizza size.
- **Toppings:** The user is prompted to input `Y` or `N` to decide whether to add toppings.
- **Extra Cheese:** The user is prompted to input `Y` or `N` to decide whether to add extra cheese.

## Example Interaction:

```bash
Welcome to Python Pizza Deliveries!
What size pizza do you want? S, M or L: M
Do you want toppings on your pizza? Y or N: Y
Do you want extra cheese? Y or N: N

Your final bill is: 23.
```
